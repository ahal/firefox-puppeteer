firefox-puppeteer
=================

A library built around [marionette-client](http://marionette-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to make automation of the Firefox UI easier.

This library is designed to make automation of commonly used widgets in the Firefox UI easier, it is not comprehensive. For automation of content webpages or elements of the Firefox UI that are less commonly used, direct use of marionette-client may be required.
